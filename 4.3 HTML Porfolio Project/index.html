     <h4>Code geass</h4>
    <p>The story of the anime makes you think about the next season every day.</p>
     <h4>Death note</h4>
    <p>Again an old one, it will cath u after the first 2 episodes, and u will don't regret watching.</p>
     <h4>Berserk</h4> 
    <p>If you don't like the blood,then don't try. It's a bit Gore, but this is the anime that got me into this "world", just as a movie an anime has it's own potential. So don't miss your life thinking the movies are the only source of content that can keep u interested.</p>
